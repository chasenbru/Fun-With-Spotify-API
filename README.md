# Fun-With-Spotify-API
The objective of this project is to use Python to gather data from the Spotify API and visualize the results in Tableau. The .py file includes comments to help you understand the logic and functions used to extract data. After extracting the data, I did some lightweight transformations using the Pandas library.
